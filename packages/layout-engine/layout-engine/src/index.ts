/**
 * Calculates the total height needed to keep a keepNext chain together on the same page.
 *
 * This function computes the combined height of all paragraphs in a keepNext chain,
 * plus the first line of the anchor paragraph. This height is used to determine
 * whether the entire chain can fit on the current page or needs to move to the next.
 *
 * The calculation accounts for:
 * - Heights of all chain member paragraphs (from their measures)
 * - Inter-paragraph spacing with OOXML spacing collapse rules (max of after/before)
 * - Contextual spacing suppression when adjacent paragraphs share the same style
 * - Effective spacing before the first chain member (considering page state)
 * - First line height of the anchor paragraph (optimization per SD-1282)
 *
 * Spacing rules per OOXML spec:
 * - Adjacent paragraph spacing collapses to max(paragraph1.after, paragraph2.before)
 * - contextualSpacing suppresses a paragraph's spacing when adjacent to same-style paragraph
 *
 * @param chain - The keepNext chain to calculate height for
 * @param blocks - All flow blocks in the document
 * @param measures - Pre-computed measures for all blocks (must be parallel array with blocks)
 * @param state - Current page state, used for trailing spacing and last paragraph style
 * @returns Total height in pixels needed to keep the chain together. Returns 0 if chain is empty.
 *
 * @example
 * // For a chain of [Heading(30px), Body(50px)] with anchor Paragraph(20px first line):
 * // Height = 0 (spacing before heading on fresh page)
 * //        + 30 (heading height)
 * //        + 12 (inter-paragraph spacing)
 * //        + 50 (body height)
 * //        + 10 (spacing to anchor)
 * //        + 20 (anchor first line)

/**
 * Normalize and validate column layout configuration, computing individual column widths.
 *
 * Takes raw column layout parameters and the available content width, then calculates
 * the actual width each column should have after accounting for gaps. Handles edge cases
 * like invalid column counts, excessive gaps, and degenerate layouts.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Validate and normalize column count (floor to integer, ensure >= 1)
 * 2. Validate and normalize gap width (ensure >= 0)
 * 3. Calculate total gap space: gap * (count - 1)
 * 4. Calculate per-column width: (contentWidth - totalGap) / count
 * 5. If resulting width is too small (≤ epsilon), fallback to single-column layout
 *
 * Edge cases handled:
 * - Undefined or missing input: Defaults to single column, no gap
 * - Invalid count (NaN, negative, zero): Defaults to 1
 * - Negative gap: Clamps to 0
 * - Column width too small (gaps consume all space): Falls back to single column
 * - Non-integer count: Floors to nearest integer
 *
 * @param input - The column layout configuration (count and gap) or undefined
 * @param contentWidth - The total available width for content in pixels (must be positive)
 * @returns Normalized column configuration with computed width per column
 * @example
 * // Two columns with 48px gap in 612px content area
 * normalizeColumns({ count: 2, gap: 48 }, 612)
 * // Returns { count: 2, gap: 48, width: 282 }
 *
 * @example
 * // Excessive gap causes fallback to single column
 * normalizeColumns({ count: 3, gap: 500 }, 600)
 * // Returns { count: 1, gap: 0, width: 600 }
