# SuperDoc: Init a DOCX from HTML Content

An example of initializing SuperDoc with HTML content.

This will load a DOCX file (or a blank document), replacing the main contents with the provided HTML.

In the example we pass `document: sample-document.docx` to load a template with a header and footer. You can omit this key to start with a blank document.
