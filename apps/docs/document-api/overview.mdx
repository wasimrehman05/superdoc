Document API gives you a consistent way to read and edit documents without relying on editor internals.

<Info>
Document API is in <strong>alpha</strong> and subject to breaking changes while the contract and adapters continue to evolve. The current API is not yet comprehensive, and more commands and namespaces are being added on an ongoing basis.

## Why use Document API

- Build automations without editor-specific code.
- Work with predictable inputs and outputs defined per operation.
- Check capabilities up front and branch safely when features are unavailable.
