<Info>
Document Engine is in <strong>alpha</strong> and subject to breaking changes while the contract and adapters continue to evolve.
</Info>

Document Engine is the programmatic surface of SuperDoc. It gives you four ways to read and edit `.docx` files without a visible editor:

| Surface | Use case | Runtime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Document API](/document-api/overview) | In-browser editing via `editor.doc.*` methods | Browser (ProseMirror) |
| [SDKs](/document-engine/sdks) | Node.js and Python wrappers for backend automation | Node / Python |
| [CLI](/document-engine/cli) | Terminal commands for scripting and CI pipelines | Any shell |
| [MCP Server](/document-engine/mcp) | AI agent access via the Model Context Protocol | Local subprocess |

All four surfaces share the same operation set. An operation like `find` is available as `editor.doc.find()` in the browser, `superdoc.doc.find()` in the SDK, `superdoc find` in the CLI, and `superdoc_find` in MCP.

## How it works

The Document API defines the canonical operations. The CLI and MCP server wrap them for different consumers. The SDKs manage the CLI process and expose typed methods.

```
Document API (source of truth)
  → CLI (terminal interface)
  → MCP Server (AI agent interface)
  → Node SDK / Python SDK (typed wrappers over CLI)
```

## Where to start

- **Building a web editor?** Start with the [Document API](/document-api/overview).
- **Automating documents from a backend?** Start with the [SDKs](/document-engine/sdks).
- **Scripting from the terminal or CI?** Start with the [CLI](/document-engine/cli).
- **Connecting AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf)?** Start with the [MCP Server](/document-engine/mcp).
