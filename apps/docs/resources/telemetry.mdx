SuperDoc collects lightweight telemetry to track document opens for usage-based billing. Telemetry is enabled by default and runs silently in the background — it never blocks rendering or breaks your app.

## What gets collected

Each time a document is opened or imported, SuperDoc sends a single event containing:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `documentId` | A hashed document identifier (not the content itself) | `a1b2c3d4...` |
| `documentCreatedAt` | The document's original creation timestamp | `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` |
| `superdocVersion` | The version of the SuperDoc library | `1.15.0` |
| `browserInfo` | User agent, hostname, and screen size | `{ hostname: "app.example.com", ... }` |
| `metadata` | Custom key-value pairs you optionally provide | `{ customerId: "123" }` |

SuperDoc does **not** collect:
- Document content or text
- User identities or personal data
- Keystrokes, edits, or change history
- Cookies or session tokens (`credentials: 'omit'`)

## How it works

1. You open or import a document
2. SuperDoc generates a **document identifier** — a hash derived from the file's metadata (not its content)
3. A single `POST` request fires to the telemetry endpoint
4. If the request fails (network error, blocked by firewall), it fails silently

```
Document opened → Generate identifier hash → POST to endpoint → Done
```

<Note>
The telemetry request is non-blocking and fire-and-forget. Your editor loads regardless of the outcome.
</Note>

## Configuration

Pass `licenseKey` and `telemetry` in your SuperDoc or SuperEditor config:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript SuperDoc
import { SuperDoc } from 'superdoc';

const superdoc = new SuperDoc({
  selector: '#editor',
  document: yourFile,
  licenseKey: 'your-license-key',
  telemetry: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

```javascript SuperEditor
import { Editor } from 'superdoc/super-editor';

const editor = await Editor.open(file, {
  element: document.querySelector('#editor'),
  licenseKey: 'your-license-key',
  telemetry: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Options

<ParamField path="licenseKey" type="string">
  Your organization's license key. Links document opens to your account for billing.
  Defaults to `community-and-eval-agplv3` if not provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="telemetry.enabled" type="boolean">
  Enable or disable telemetry. Default: `true`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="telemetry.endpoint" type="string">
  Override the telemetry endpoint. Default: `https://ingest.superdoc.dev/v1/collect`. Useful for proxying through your own infrastructure.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="telemetry.metadata" type="Record<string, unknown>">
  Custom key-value pairs included with every event. Use this to attach your own identifiers (customer ID, environment, etc.).
</ParamField>

### Disabling telemetry

Set `enabled: false` to turn telemetry off entirely:

```javascript
const superdoc = new SuperDoc({
  selector: '#editor',
  document: yourFile,
  telemetry: {
    enabled: false,
  },
});
```

No network requests will be made. Document metadata (GUID and timestamp) is still generated locally so files export correctly.

## License key

The license key identifies your organization. It's sent as an `X-License-Key` header with every telemetry request.

| License type | Key | How to get it |
|-------------|-----|---------------|
| Community / evaluation | `community-and-eval-agplv3` (default) | No action needed — used automatically |
| Commercial | Your organization key | Email [q@superdoc.dev](mailto:q@superdoc.dev) |

If you're evaluating SuperDoc or using it under AGPLv3, you don't need to configure a license key. The community key is applied automatically.

For a commercial license key, email [q@superdoc.dev](mailto:q@superdoc.dev). You'll receive a key tied to your organization that unlocks usage tracking for your account.

## How document uniqueness works

SuperDoc needs to identify each document uniquely so that opening the same file twice counts as one document, not two. This matters for accurate billing.

### Identifier strategies

SuperDoc uses two strategies depending on what metadata the file contains:

**1. Metadata hash — file already has a GUID and timestamp**

DOCX files created by Microsoft Word (and other tools) typically contain a unique GUID and a creation timestamp in their internal metadata (`docProps/` and `word/settings.xml`). When both are present, SuperDoc hashes them together:

```
documentId = hash(GUID | creationTimestamp)   →   "HASH-A1B2C3D4"
```

This is the most stable strategy. The same file always produces the same identifier regardless of content edits, because the hash is derived from metadata, not content.

**2. Generated identifier — file is missing metadata**

Some tools produce DOCX files without a GUID or timestamp. When either is missing, SuperDoc does two things:

1. **For the current open**: generates a content hash of the raw file bytes so the same file still produces a consistent identifier
2. **For future opens**: generates the missing GUID and/or timestamp and embeds them into the document's metadata

The generated metadata is saved when you export. On the next import, the file now has both a GUID and timestamp, so SuperDoc switches to the stable metadata hash automatically.

```
First open:  no GUID in file → content hash used, GUID + timestamp generated
Export:      GUID + timestamp written into the file
Next open:   GUID + timestamp found → metadata hash (stable from now on)
```

This self-healing behavior means document identification improves automatically as files pass through SuperDoc. After one export cycle, every document gets a permanent, edit-resistant identifier.

## Payload example

Here's what a telemetry request looks like on the wire:

```
POST https://ingest.superdoc.dev/v1/collect
Content-Type: application/json
X-License-Key: your-license-key
```

```json
{
  "superdocVersion": "1.15.0",
  "browserInfo": {
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "currentUrl": "https://app.example.com/doc/123",
    "hostname": "app.example.com",
    "screenSize": { "width": 1920, "height": 1080 }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "customerId": "cust-456"
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-02-12T14:30:00.000Z",
      "documentId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
      "documentCreatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Try it: document counting demo

See document uniqueness in action. Upload a DOCX file and watch the counter — then try the steps below.

import { DocCounter } from '/snippets/components/doc-counter.jsx'

<DocCounter height="300px" />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a DOCX file">
    Click **Upload DOCX** and pick any `.docx` file. The counter goes to **1**. SuperDoc reads the file's internal metadata and generates a document identifier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the document">
    Make some changes in the editor — add text, delete a paragraph, change formatting. The identifier stays the same because it's based on metadata, not content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export and re-import">
    Click **Export & re-import**. SuperDoc exports the document to DOCX and immediately re-imports it. The counter stays at **1** — same metadata, same identifier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload a different file">
    Upload a second DOCX file. The counter goes to **2**. Each file with distinct metadata gets its own identifier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-upload the first file">
    Upload the original file again. The counter stays at **2**. SuperDoc recognizes it as the same document.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The event log at the bottom shows exactly what SuperDoc sees: the identifier hash, whether a document is new or recognized, and how many times each has been opened.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Does telemetry affect performance?">
No. The request is non-blocking and fire-and-forget. Your editor loads and renders regardless of the telemetry outcome.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if telemetry fails?">
Nothing. Errors are caught silently. No retries, no queuing, no user-visible errors. Your app continues to work normally.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I route telemetry through my own server?">
Yes. Set `telemetry.endpoint` to your proxy URL. The payload format stays the same.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does the same document get counted twice?">
Not if it has metadata. SuperDoc hashes the document's GUID and creation timestamp, so the same file produces the same identifier every time. See [How document uniqueness works](#how-document-uniqueness-works) above.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need a license key for open-source use?">
No. The community key (`community-and-eval-agplv3`) is applied automatically when you don't provide one.
