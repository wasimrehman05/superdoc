Your documents are never persisted. Every API call is stateless — process and forget. That's the point.

Convert contracts to PDF. Add signatures to agreements. Merge quarterly reports. Everything preserves—tracked changes, complex tables, nested lists, headers. Real document operations via REST API.

## Why stateless matters

Enterprise documents contain sensitive data. NDAs, financial reports, legal contracts. SuperDoc's API processes them in memory and returns results immediately. No storage. No persistence. No risk.

## Base URL
```
https://api.superdoc.dev
```

## Authentication

Bearer token in every request (except `/v1/health`):

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sd_sk_abc123xyz789
```

## What's working now

**Convert** - DOCX to PDF with perfect fidelity. That 50-page contract with tracked changes? Converts flawlessly.

```bash
POST /v1/convert?from=docx
```

**Annotate** - Programmatically populate fields in your DOCX templates. Insert text, images, signatures, and tables.

```bash
POST /v1/annotate
```

**Sign** - Add cryptographic signatures to PDFs and DOCX documents with full audit trail support.

```bash
POST /v1/sign
```

**Verify** - Validate the authenticity and integrity of signed PDFs.

```bash
POST /v1/verify
```

## What's coming

`/merge` - Combine documents with formatting intact. <br />

## Built for real documents

This isn't a wrapper around LibreOffice. SuperDoc uses custom document processing that handles:

- Tables spanning multiple pages
- Tracked changes from multiple reviewers  
- Embedded images and charts
- Complex numbered lists and cross-references
- Headers/footers with dynamic fields

Your Word documents work because SuperDoc was built for Word documents. Not markdown. Not HTML — actual DOCX files.
